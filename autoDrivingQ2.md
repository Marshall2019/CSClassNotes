# 2018 IB CS Case Study: Automonous Driving. Question 2


## 1) what does the question mean?

Fairly simple. The question just means what it means. 

Explanations for VTV, VTI, and CNN may facilitates question understanding.

VTV stands for vehicle to vehicle, and is a protocal for information transfer between vehicles. Similarly, VTI, vehicle to infrastructure, is another protocal for information transfer between vehicles and infrastructures related to roads. CNN, convolutional neural networks, is a type of neural network that guides how the car moves.

## 2) why was that question chosen? (What is the rationale or connection to the case study?)

The topic discussed is related to some of the concepts and decisions in the case study. Especially some protocals and some advanced moral issue related to the technology. The examiner wants to check our understanding towards them. 

## 3) what is the answer to that question?

### (a)

VTV facilitates communication between vehicles, talking about their speed, location, direction of travel, braking, and loss of stability. This helps vehicle's route choosing, speed control, safety control, emergency management and etc..

VTI provides communication between vehicles and overhead RFID readers and cameras, traffic lights, lane markers, streetlights, signage and parking meters. It enables vehicles to report road information to the passangers, and report massive vehicles information to the infrastructure to facilitate traffic management.

In a autonomous car only city, communnication would be extremely powerful, because traffic information is totally shared. Route selection and other kinds of NN calculations would be greatly facilitated.

### (b)

Low importance is required.

Trolley Problem doesn't have a solution until now, because different ethical rules have different answers on that. It's quite hard for a computer to think about that.

It's ambigious whether computer should pay any ethical responsibilities, because computers needs to have a mind to make ethical decisions. As Yuval Noah Harari states, we still don't know what mind is, and it's a important topic for research. We don't know whether computer have a mind to pay responsibilities, so we don't know whether to blame the consequence of each decision or not.

CNN follows the training input of human drivers. A rational decision is to let the human drivers to be as ethical as possible, and let CNN mimic the ethical decisions.

## 4) what is a question for this yearâ€™s case study that uses the same why (rationale or connection)?
I beleive there could be more moral questions related to EMIS. For example, when the system receives request of emergency issue of the same emergency level but only limited resources available, which emergency location would the ambulance going? How to select the target without lossing too much time hesitating? Or is there a better solution to make sure that the resources are enough for emergency dispatch.
The questions for this year's case study, there could also be questions about transmittion protocals such as HTTP and its pros and cons when connecting old CAD system to EMIS system which is mentioned in the reading material.
